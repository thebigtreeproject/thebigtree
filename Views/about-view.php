		<h1>About Us</h1>
			<div>
				<p>TheBigTree was a finale project for Web Developer students in Vancouver. They wanted to make a difference for people with special needs. A non-disable person can have difficulty finding the right place to go to do their haircut due to price and location. If a non-disable person has this difficulty, imagine how difficult it is for a disabled person who has special needs must be?</p>
                <p>People with disability have no choice in the matter of where to go. Their choices are limited and are based on the companies accessibility and employees experiences.</p>
                <p>TheBigTree group created the idea that instead of they look for a service the company searches for them. We want to connect individuals and companies together by helping them help themselves.
